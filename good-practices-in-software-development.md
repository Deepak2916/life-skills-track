# Good Practices in Software Development


## 1. What is your one major takeaway from each one of the six sections?

Key insights from the six sections:

1. Capturing comprehensive notes during requirement discussions is valuable; involving teammates and sharing notes fosters clarity and validation.

2. Maintaining consistent communication with team members about even minor discrepancies is crucial for effective collaboration.

3. When encountering obstacles, seeking assistance from colleagues is beneficial; clear communication of the problem and attempted solutions facilitates efficient problem-solving.

4. Cultivating positive relationships and utilizing communication as a tool sustains a healthy and amicable team environment; regular interactions with colleagues are essential.

5. Respect for colleagues' time is important; opting for real-time conversations over frequent back-and-forth exchanges enhances productivity.

6. Achieving optimal focus during work hours contributes to higher efficiency; minimizing distractions, such as silencing phones and limiting social media, aids in concentration.

## 2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

Two areas I aim to enhance are:

1. Overcoming the tendency to independently solve problems when stuck, I recognize the value of seeking assistance from colleagues to improve communication and teamwork. I plan to implement a technique of asking for help after successfully completing another task, forming a new habit.

2. Enhancing note-taking during requirement discussions is a priority. To progress, I intend to leverage my iPad and Apple Pencil, offering a professional and organized approach. Utilizing digital tools allows for unlimited note storage and seamless sharing with teammates.

By adopting these improvements, I aspire to promote effective communication, teamwork, and personal organization in the realm of software development.
