## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

### Your takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible
1. Making lasting change is best achieved by focusing on tiny habits rather than grand aspirations or relying solely on motivation.
2. Tiny habits are created by finding an existing behavior (anchor), making the desired behavior tiny, and celebrating immediately after performing the behavior.
3. Motivation is not the most reliable factor in behavior change, and it's important to focus on ability and triggers.
4. Ability factors include time, money, physical capability, mental energy, and fitting the behavior into your routine.
5. Action prompts, such as existing behaviors, are effective in reminding and triggering new habits.
6. Celebrating successes and creating positive emotions associated with the behavior are key to solidifying the habit in your brain and making it stick.
7. The choice of anchor, frequency, and theme/purpose of the behavior should be considered when creating a tiny habit.
8. Recognizing and celebrating achievements, no matter how small, is crucial for reinforcing habits and creating lasting change.

### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?

1. Identify and increase your motivation by connecting the habit to your values, setting meaningful goals, and reminding yourself of the benefits.
2. Simplify the habit by breaking it down into small, manageable actions that can be easily achieved in a short amount of time.
3. Enhance your ability to perform the habit by addressing any obstacles or challenges that may arise. Acquire necessary skills, gather resources, and adjust your environment or routine as needed.
4. Utilize effective prompts or triggers, such as existing behaviors or environmental cues, to remind and cue you to perform the habit consistently.

### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

1. Celebrating after each successful completion of a habit reinforces positive emotions and creates a sense of achievement, which boosts motivation and confidence.
2. It trains your brain to associate the habit with a positive experience, making it more enjoyable and increasing the likelihood of repeating the behavior in the future.
3. Celebrating creates a feedback loop that strengthens the neural pathways associated with the habit, making it easier to perform the behavior automatically over time.
4. The act of celebrating after each successful completion provides a sense of progress and fulfillment, making the habit formation process more enjoyable and sustainable in the long run.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day Video

### Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)

1. The story of British Cycling and Dave Brailsford demonstrates the power of the "aggregation of marginal gains" philosophy, which focuses on making 1% improvements in various areas to achieve significant success over time.

2. Noticing is a crucial stage in habit formation, as you need to be aware of the habit and its potential benefits before you can take action. Implementing implementation intentions, such as creating specific plans for when, where, and how you will perform the habit, can increase your chances of success.

3. The environment plays a significant role in shaping our habits. By designing your environment to make good habits easier and bad habits more difficult, you can increase your likelihood of sticking to positive behaviors. For example, placing your guitar in a visible spot in your living room can encourage you to practice more frequently.

4. Getting started is often the most challenging part of building habits. The Two-Minute Rule suggests that any habit can be started in less than two minutes, and by focusing on initiating the habit, you can overcome procrastination and develop consistency.

5. Enjoyment and immediate rewards are essential for maintaining habits. Finding ways to bring rewards into the present moment can help you stay motivated. The Seinfeld strategy, which involves tracking your progress and not breaking the chain of consistency, can provide immediate rewards and reinforce the habit. Additionally, small rewards or positive experiences during the habit can enhance your liking for it and increase the chances of repetition.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

### Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes and outcomes?

Here are few key points about habit formation from the perspective of identity, processes, and outcomes:

1. Identity: Changing our identity is crucial for habit change. By adopting the identity of the person who embodies the desired habits, we can make lasting changes.

2. Processes: Focusing on systems and processes, rather than just setting goals, is important for building successful habits. Systems create a sustainable framework for behavior change.

3. Outcomes: Goals alone are not enough for lasting change. It is essential to prioritize the small, daily actions that lead to those outcomes.

4. Habit Formation: The habit formation process consists of cues, cravings, responses, and rewards. Optimizing each step of this habit loop is key to building effective habits.

5. Compound Effects: Small improvements made consistently over time have a compounding effect and lead to significant transformations in the long run.

### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier?


1. Reduce Friction: Minimize the effort required to perform the habit. Make it as easy as possible to start. Remove any unnecessary steps, obstacles, or distractions that could hinder the habit. For example, prepare your workout clothes the night before to make it easier to exercise in the morning.

2. Create a Clear Cue: Establish a clear and obvious trigger or cue that prompts the habit. This could be a specific time, location, or preceding action that serves as a reminder. By making the cue prominent and distinct, you increase the likelihood of initiating the habit consistently.

3. Use Habit Stacking: Pair the new habit with an existing habit that you already do consistently. This technique leverages the power of an existing routine to anchor the new habit. For instance, if you want to develop a habit of flossing, you can associate it with brushing your teeth, making it easier to remember and incorporate into your daily routine.

4. Make it Attractive: Find ways to make the habit more appealing and enjoyable. This can be done by adding elements of pleasure or reward to the habit. For example, listening to your favorite music or a captivating audiobook while exercising can make the habit more enticing.

5. Optimize the Environment: Set up your environment to support the desired habit. Make sure everything you need is readily available and within reach. Arrange your space in a way that encourages the habit and removes any temptations or distractions that might hinder it. For instance, if you want to eat healthier, stock your kitchen with nutritious foods and keep unhealthy snacks out of sight.

### Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult?

1. Increase Friction: Introduce obstacles or steps that make it harder to perform the bad habit. Create barriers or delays that require more effort or time. By increasing the friction associated with the habit, you make it less appealing and more challenging to engage in consistently.

2. Make the Cue Invisible: Minimize or eliminate cues that trigger the bad habit. Remove visual or environmental cues that prompt the behavior. For example, if you have a habit of mindlessly snacking on unhealthy foods while watching TV, keep those foods out of sight or replace them with healthier options.

3. Make it Unattractive: Associate negative consequences or emotions with the bad habit. Highlight the downsides and drawbacks of engaging in the behavior. This can be done by linking the habit to negative outcomes or visualizing the negative impact it has on your well-being or goals.

4. Disrupt the Routine: Break the chain of events that lead to the bad habit. Identify the patterns or triggers that precede the behavior and intervene at those moments. Introduce alternative actions or distractions that redirect your focus and prevent the habit from unfolding.

5. Eliminate Rewards: Remove or reduce the immediate gratification or reward associated with the bad habit. Find ways to make the habit less satisfying or enjoyable. For example, if you're trying to reduce excessive screen time, disable notifications or use apps that limit your access to certain websites or apps.

## 5. Reflection:

### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

One habit that I would like to do more of is reading books regularly. To make this habit more ingrained in my routine, I can take several steps to make the cue obvious, the habit more attractive, and the response satisfying:

1. Make the Cue Obvious:
   - Place a book or an e-reader in a visible and easily accessible location, such as on my bedside table or on a bookshelf in the living room.
   - Set a specific time each day for reading, such as allocating 30 minutes before bedtime or during lunch breaks.

2. Make the Habit More Attractive:
   - Create a cozy and inviting reading environment with comfortable seating, soft lighting, and a peaceful atmosphere.
   - Select books that align with my interests and preferences to make the reading experience enjoyable and engaging.

3. Make the Habit Easy:
   - Break down reading into manageable chunks, such as committing to reading at least 10 pages per day.
   - Carry a book or have an e-reader with me whenever I'm on the go, so I can take advantage of any free moments to read.

4. Make the Response Satisfying:
   - Keep a reading journal or create a Goodreads account to track the books I've read and set reading goals.
   - Discuss and share book recommendations with friends or join a book club to foster a sense of community and gain new perspectives on the books I read.

By implementing these steps, I can make the habit of reading more books easier and more attractive. Making the cue obvious by having visible reminders, making the habit attractive through a pleasant reading environment, making it easy by breaking it into smaller tasks, and making the response satisfying through tracking progress and engaging in book-related discussions will help me establish a consistent reading habit.

### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier?

According to the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, there are several strategies to make a good habit easier to adopt and maintain. Here are the book's perspectives on how to make a good habit easier:

1. Reduce Friction:
   - Minimize the effort required to perform the habit by eliminating any unnecessary steps or obstacles. For example, if you want to exercise in the morning, lay out your workout clothes the night before to make it easier to get started.
   - Optimize your environment to support the habit. Arrange your physical space in a way that makes the desired behavior more convenient. For instance, if you want to eat healthier, keep nutritious snacks readily available and place them in visible locations.

2. Use Implementation Intentions:
   - Clearly define when and where you will engage in the desired habit. This specific planning helps you overcome decision fatigue and automates the behavior. For example, instead of saying, "I'll exercise more," specify, "I'll go for a 30-minute walk every day after dinner."

3. Employ Habit Stacking:
   - Attach the desired habit to an existing habit or routine. By linking the new behavior to something you already do consistently, you leverage the existing habit as a cue. For instance, if you want to meditate daily, commit to doing it right after brushing your teeth in the morning.

4. Start Small with Micro Habits:
   - Break down the habit into small, manageable actions that are easy to accomplish. By starting with tiny steps, you reduce the resistance and increase the likelihood of success. For example, if you want to establish a writing habit, start with writing just one sentence per day.

5. Use Visual Cues:
   - Make the habit more prominent and visible by using visual cues as reminders. Place sticky notes, posters, or other visual prompts in strategic locations to prompt the desired behavior. For instance, if you want to drink more water, place a water bottle on your desk as a visual reminder.

By implementing these strategies, you can make a good habit easier to adopt and sustain. By reducing friction, using implementation intentions, habit stacking, starting with small actions, and using visual cues, you set yourself up for success and increase the likelihood of integrating the habit into your daily life.

### Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult?

In "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, the book offers insights on how to make a bad habit more difficult to engage in. Here are the book's perspectives on making a bad habit more challenging:

1. Increase Friction:
   - Introduce obstacles or create additional steps that make it harder to engage in the undesired habit. For example, if you want to reduce time spent on social media, remove social media apps from your phone or use website blockers to limit access.

2. Change Your Environment:
   - Modify your surroundings to discourage the bad habit. Rearrange your environment or remove cues that trigger the habit. For instance, if you want to stop snacking on unhealthy foods, remove them from your pantry and replace them with healthier options.

3. Use Implementation Intentions:
   - Define specific situations where you will avoid the bad habit and make a plan for alternative behaviors. By being proactive and having a clear strategy, you can reduce the likelihood of falling into the undesired habit. For example, if you tend to procrastinate by watching TV, set a rule that you will work on a specific task before turning on the television.

4. Employ Habit Reversal:
   - Identify the specific cue or trigger that leads to the bad habit and develop a new response to replace it. By consciously interrupting the habitual pattern and replacing it with a different behavior, you can gradually weaken the bad habit. For instance, if you habitually bite your nails when feeling stressed, learn a relaxation technique like deep breathing to use instead.

5. Make the Consequences Clear:
   - Increase your awareness of the negative consequences associated with the bad habit. By vividly understanding the negative impact, you can create a mental deterrent that makes the habit less appealing. For example, if you want to reduce spending on unnecessary items, visualize the debt or financial stress that impulsive purchases can lead to.

By implementing these strategies, you can make a bad habit more difficult to engage in. By increasing friction, changing your environment, using implementation intentions, employing habit reversal, and making the consequences clear, you create barriers that discourage the undesired behavior and make it easier to break the habit loop.
